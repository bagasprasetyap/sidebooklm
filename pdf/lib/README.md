# PDF.js bundle placeholder

Copy the `pdf.min.mjs` (or `pdf.js`) and `pdf.worker.min.js` builds from `pdfjs-dist@4.x` into this directory.

The extension expects:

- `pdf/lib/pdf.mjs` or `pdf/lib/pdf.min.mjs`
- `pdf/lib/pdf.worker.min.js`

These files are not committed to keep the repository lightweight. Follow the [PDF.js download instructions](https://github.com/mozilla/pdfjs-dist) to obtain the latest builds.
